# node-first-project
This is my first project using Node. I wanted to try a simple thing to get the basics of Node and Express. 
Just a button, when you click it first the app is going to fetch information about a random celestial body and then we are doing a search for a picture of that body.
Once our response is ready on the server side we send it to the front and voila!
